            <p class='lead'>Hey, August cuties! Thank you, so so much, forever, for helping me make this.</p>
            <p><i>controls: arrow keys to move. (also, a funny emergent secret: if you switch to a new tab while the song is speeding up or slowing down, you can freeze it at different playback rates!)</i></p>
            <p>So, look! She's walking around in a real room now! v exciting.</p>
            <p>This month I made a few important steps forward with this game:</p>
              <ol>
                <li>I spent a long time really dialing in this room. Lots of pixel-art, which is so meticulous and fun. I loved, for example, animating that cat up there â€” the eyes just move one pixel to the right, and then one to the left, and it looks like she's turning her head!</li>
                <li>I also dreamed up the basic structure of the entire game, which looks a lot different than it did when I started. It's going to be a lot bigger game than I originally planned for, so don't hold your breath. I'll keep updating you on the progress every month, and hopefully have a playable build here with every bundle. But I might not finish this one for a while.</li>
                <li>Here's the basic idea: in the final version, there will be 5-6 vignettes, each of which correspond to (and control/distort/augment some aspect of) a song from <i>atongue[</i> and each of which will be accessed via this room, which will act as a sort of main hub. They'll all be small & directly related to my experience taking care of my grandmother, who has dementia. If any of you have family or friends with alzheimer's or dementia (and are open to sharing your experiences), I'd love to talk! I'm looking to make this game something that feels thick and lived-in and full of a real sense of those diseases, while at the same time capturing the lovely, funny, creative, engaging, wonderful parts of my life with my grandmother.</li>
                <li>The next vignette I'm going to build is a game where you have to make coffee. I'm hoping it'll be done for the September bundle! Wish me luck!</li>
              </ol>
            <p>Thanks again, thanks again, thanks again. I hope you all have a lovely September! See you in a while!</p>
